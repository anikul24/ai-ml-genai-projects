Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search.

Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\nbackground knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\nappropriate substructures.

We define the degree of\nbelief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large.

        "summary": "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown\nfunction f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k\n``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training\nexamples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning\nproblems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the\ndecision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning\nalgorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and\napplication of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output\nrepresentations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique\nin which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output\nrepresentation. We show that these output representations improve the\ngeneralization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of\nmulticlass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust\nwith respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of\ndistributed representations to particular classes, and the application of\noverfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we\nshow that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can\nprovide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results\ndemonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method\nfor improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass\nproblems.",

        "summary": "The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan\ndebugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or\nrepairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a\ndomain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound,\ncomplete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the\nliterature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of\npartial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from\nnode to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a\nlibrary plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for\nthe search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same\nrefinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract\nconstraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that\nthe adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its\nsystematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any\nparts of the graph.",

Currently the most important application of these methods is to\ntemporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of\nTD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general\nimplementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement\nlearning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional\napproach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both\ninefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)\nprocedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates\nTD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used\nwith arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is\nderived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.\nEncouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda\n&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning\nspeedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",

While the\noriginal representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more\naccurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky,\ncumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a\ncoarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory.

As a\nresult, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,\nhindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded\noptimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a\nsolution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture\nand the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property\nfor a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time\nenvironments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated\nmail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded\noptimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical\ncomplexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs\nthat are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO\nprograms can be used as building blocks for more complex systems.

Tutorial instruction is a\nflexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an\ninstructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in\nwhatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the\nagent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of\ninstructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves\nsuch learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It\ncombines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each\ninstruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete\nexplanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar\nthat learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from\ninteractive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key\nrequirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous\nsystems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;\n(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to\na hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,\nconditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class\nof knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",

        "title": "Generalization of Clauses under Implication",
        "summary": "In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and\nthe usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently\nthere has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in\nmachine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform\ngeneralization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of\nimplication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\nto compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\nimplication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\nfor learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\nthe basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between\nclauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of\nimplication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show\nthat for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general\ngeneralization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce\ngeneralizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under\ntheta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover\nwe show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete\nexpansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the\nclause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",

        "summary": "Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for\nHorn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are\nincomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore\nnatural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these\nrepresentations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in\ndatabase theory, where it has applications to the design of relational\ndatabases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems.\nOur main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under\npolynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding\ndecision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given\nset of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression.\nWe also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well\nknown problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no\npolynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation\nproblems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a\nspecial case they are equivalent to it.",

        "summary": "Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular\nbiology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal\nreasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for\nrepresenting temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for\ndetermining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding\none or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two\nimportant algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a\nbacktracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop\ntechniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly\noptimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable\nand value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously\nsuggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time\nand space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the\ntechniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems\nthat are of practical size.",

In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in\nO(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the\nnetwork. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us\nto answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence\nabsorption.
