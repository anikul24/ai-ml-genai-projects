# ai-ml-genai-projects
A collection of Machine Learning, AI, and Generative AI projects, covering end-to-end workflows from data engineering to model deployment. Includes classical ML models, modern deep learning techniques, and GenAI/agentic AI use cases. Focus on real-world applications in finance, data pipelines, and production-ready MLOps practices.



Each project has:
- 📓 **Notebooks** for experimentation & EDA  
- 🛠 **Source code** for training/inference  
- 📊 **Data (sample / synthetic)** for reproducibility  
- 🏗 **Deployment setup** (Docker, CI/CD, Streamlit/FastAPI apps)
